Mr de Beer is a professional architect employed by the University of Pretoria. He is married and has two grownup children. He serves as advisor on both AFSA's Technical Committee and grading panel and was a former president of AFSA.</p>

              <p>He has almost 40 years experience in Aikido and other Japanese martial arts and was a founder member of both the Aikido Federation of South Africa (AFSA) and the Confederation of South African Martial Arts (later MASA).

              <p>He became interested in Aikido after his mentor and Karate sensei, the charismatic Richard Salmon, introduced him to the writings of Tohei sensei and Ueshiba Kisshomaru Doshu. Salmon sensei had met and trained with O'Sensei Ueshiba in the late 60's during a special study tour to Japan.</p>

              <p>De Beer's training started in 1976 at the Bloemfontein General Hospital's Physiotherapy Department. His main training partner was his close friend, Fritz Zöllner. During December 1977 the dojos of Durban, Bloemfontein and Cape Town joined forces under Dave Buchanan and founded the Aikido Federation of South Africa (AFSA).</p>
